# Week 2 
## What I did during this session:

-Finalized the Requirement Specification document for the project. I contributed by writing the Non-functional Requirements, creating Personas, and drafting User Stories. These components helped us better define the system's performance expectations, identify key user roles, and outline specific user interactions with the platform. 
-Discussed and refined the project scope with my team, ensuring alignment with the client's expectations and technical feasibility. 

## What I intend to do before the next session:

System Architecture:
-Collaborate with my team to create the C4 Context Diagram (Level 1) and C4 Container Diagram (Level 2) to define the high-level system architecture and its components. 
-Work with my team to draft the Use Case Diagram, outlining the interactions between users and the system.

Research and Analysis:
-Explore popular 3D modeling websites(e.g Sketchfab, Autodesk Viewer, Thingiverse) to gather inspiration and understand industry standards.
-Take screenshots on features I like, such as user interface design, collaboration tools and file management.
-Discuss with my team which features align with our project goals and how we can incorporate them into our platform. 

Prototype Development:
-Individually, I will draw the raw prototype for the website project using Adobe Photoshop. This will include creating initial wireframes and mockups to visualize the user interface, navigation flow, and key features such as model upload, real-time commenting and version control.
-Collaborate with my team to refine the prototype using Figma, incorporating insights from the research phase to ensure it aligns with the project requirements and user expectations. 

## Any issues arising and how I intend to resolve them:
-No major issues have arisen so far. However, as we move into the design and architecture phase, I anticipate challenges in balancing performance, scalability, and user experience. To address this, I plan to conduct thorough research, consult with my team, and iterate on our designs to ensure they meet both technical and user requirements. Additionally, we will continue to communicate with the client to clarify any remaining uncertainties.
