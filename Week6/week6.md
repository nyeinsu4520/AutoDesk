# Week 6

## What I Did During This Session
During this session, I worked on writing my STAR analysis report for the project. I started by reviewing all the project materials, such as the MoSCoW analysis and client feedback, to make sure I understood the project and my role clearly.I broke the report into four parts:
Situation – I explained the project, its goals, and the challenges we faced.
Task – I described my role and the responsibilities I had in the team.
Action – I talked about what I did to complete my tasks and how I worked with my team.
Result – I reflected on what I accomplished and what I learned from the experience.
I used evidence from our GitHub repository, like commit history and pull requests, to show my contributions. After writing the first draft of the report, I reviewed it and made changes to make sure it was clear and followed the assignment guidelines.

## What I intend to do before the next session:
Before the next session, I plan to research how to upload larger files using the Autodesk API. Specifically, I will focus on understanding the API’s file handling capabilities and any limitations associated with uploading files as large as 400MB. This will involve:
Reviewing the Autodesk API documentation to understand the proper methods for handling large file uploads. Researching any potential limitations or performance concerns when uploading large files.
Exploring best practices for efficiently managing large file uploads to ensure smooth performance.
By completing this research, I will gain a better understanding of how to implement the file upload functionality in our project, ensuring it meets the client’s requirements.


## Any issues arising and how I intend to resolve them:
One issue I might face while preparing for the assignment is managing my time, as I have other tasks to complete as well. To solve this, I will create a schedule and set aside specific time for each part of the STAR report. Another challenge could be finding enough supporting evidence since I may not have tracked everything properly. I have taken some screenshots, but not all, so I will organize them to support my work diary. We also received client feedback about their expectations for the next sprint, but for now, I will focus on completing this report first.
